Models\n","You connected to an open-source LLM through Hugging Face's free Inference API using `HuggingFaceEndpoint` and `ChatHuggingFace`. You saw that LangChain is model-agnostic — swap one line and your entire pipeline works with a different model.\n","\n","#### 2. Prompt Templates\n","You replaced messy f-strings with `ChatPromptTemplate` — reusable, version-able, and variable-injected. You built templates with single and multiple variables, and experimented with system personas.\n","\n","#### 3. Output Parsers\n","You defined a `Pydantic` schema and used `PydanticOutputParser` to force the LLM to return structured JSON instead of raw text. This is what separates a demo from a production app.\n","\n","#### 4. Chains (LCEL)\n","You piped everything together with the `|` operator:\n","\n","```python\n","chain = prompt | chat_model | parser\n","```\n","\n","Three pipes. Three transformations.
